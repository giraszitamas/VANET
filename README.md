# VANET

n a modern community, traveling and delivery of goods are
necessary. Technological progress has made in the automotive
industry that makes the products cheaper, hence more and
more cars are appearing on the roads. As technology improves,
the vehicles are equipped with a wide range of sensors and
devices to make drivers’ daily lives easier. The data collected
is useful not only for the driver, but it is also valuable for other
drivers in the ecosystem. Various applications can also use this
information, whether to plan smarter routes or to help drivers
to drive more safely. Connecting cars makes the transport
easier and safer for people. An accident can be prevented if
the driver is informed about the road conditions.
Vehicle Adhoc Network (VANET) is a communication
network where vehicles can communicate to infrastructure
(V2I) and also to vehicles (V2V). However, this network
is also used by adversaries with malicious intent. They can
intercept, spoof, modify or replay messages transmitted over
the wireless network. They do this for a variety of reasons,
such as making travel impossible or causing traffic jams, or
just specifically attack an individual. They may also observe
a person’s private travel patterns, which could be the basis for
an organized robbery.
